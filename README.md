# BUSFACTOR_RISK_ANALYSIS
The Bus Factor designates the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a bus (or in simpler words quit) 
before a project is incapacitated.1 I extended this factor to be yearly from a single lifetime value and did some
feature engineering to generate new features and explore if these can be better used to predict continuation of
project or in other words to see if bus factor can play a role in knowing if project will be active or dead. 

Results show that these features are better in predicting the life of a project and that the extended bus factor
is a good measure of risk.
